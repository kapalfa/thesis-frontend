# A web framework for collaborative code development 
This repository consists of the frontend of my thesis "A web framework for collaborative code development"

## What the application does 

The application creates a collaborative coding environment for developers. 
Every user can create an account in the app and log in with the appropriate credentials.
In their account, the users can create new projects or download projects from their GitHub accounts.
In those projects, they can store their files and folders and edit and view their contents. 
Any project can be shared among many users, who gain editing permission to the project in this way. 
The app offers a code editor for editing and viewing purposes, a live chat between collaborators, GitHub integration and many more features.
